# Belka
For study and analysis of the Belka dataset

**Problem:** Predict drug bindings to 3 specific protiens related to cardiovascular diseases ~ 10million drug molecules. Binding rate of 0.017%, highly imbalanced data. 

* Developed and analyzed feature extraction methods and studied multiple methods of feature computations.

* Tried Logistic, Random forest, XGBoost, and combination algorithms

* Combination model (Logistic on molecular features + XGboost on fingerprint features) resulted in a PPV 32 times greater than the underlying prevalence, greatly improving accuracy of the predictions.

* Analyses of the most important features and their clinical relevance remains to be explored.
